What You Need Before You Begin
------------------------------

Before you start the sign-up process in Thunderbird, make sure you have the following:

- A computer with an internet connection.
- A valid email address from a provider such as Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, or a custom domain.
- Your email login credentials (email address and password).
- Optional: Your email server settings (IMAP/POP and SMTP), especially if you are using a custom domain or enterprise provider.

Installing Thunderbird
----------------------

If you have not yet installed Thunderbird, follow these instructions:

- Go to the official Thunderbird website using a web browser.
- Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- After installation, launch the Thunderbird application.

Starting the Account Setup
--------------------------

When you open Thunderbird for the first time, it will prompt you to add an email account automatically. If it doesn't, or if you already use Thunderbird and want to add another account, follow these steps:

- Open Thunderbird.
- Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
- Navigate to **Account Settings**.
- At the bottom, click **Account Actions** and then select **Add Mail Account**.

This will open the **Mail Account Setup** window.

Entering Email Information
--------------------------

In the setup window, you will be asked to provide the following details:

- **Your Name**: This is the display name that will appear in the “From” field when you send an email.
- **Email Address**: Enter your full email address.
- **Password**: Input the password associated with your email account.

After entering this information, click the **Continue** button.

Automatic Email Configuration
-----------------------------

Thunderbird will attempt to detect your email provider’s settings automatically. It will search for the correct IMAP or POP3 settings for incoming mail and SMTP settings for outgoing mail.

If the automatic setup is successful:

- You will see a summary of the settings Thunderbird detected.
- You can choose between IMAP (remote folders) and POP3 (local folders).
- Click **Done** to finish the configuration.

Manual Email Configuration
--------------------------

If the automatic setup fails or you prefer to enter settings manually:

- Click the **Manual Config** button.
- Enter the incoming and outgoing server settings manually, including:
  - Server type (IMAP or POP)
  - Server hostname
  - Port number
  - SSL method (STARTTLS, SSL/TLS)
  - Authentication method (usually Normal Password)
  - Username (usually your email address)

After filling in all required fields, click **Re-test** to validate the configuration.

- If the test is successful, click **Done**.
- If it fails, double-check your entries and consult your email provider’s support documentation for accurate settings.

Verifying the Setup
-------------------

Once your account has been added:

- Thunderbird will attempt to log in to both the incoming and outgoing mail servers.
- If successful, your inbox will be populated with your existing emails.
- You can send a test email to verify that outgoing mail is working correctly.

Thunderbird will now begin synchronizing your email messages. Depending on the size of your inbox and internet speed, this might take a few minutes.

Optional Configuration
----------------------

After signing up and setting up your account in Thunderbird, consider these additional configurations:

- Under the **Signature Text** box, enter your desired signature.

POP
